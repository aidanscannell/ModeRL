* Saved Models
This directory contains the saved models that were used to generate the plot in the paper.

- [[artificial/rbf_gating_kernel]] is our model trained on the artificial data set using a squared exponential
  covariance function for the gating network GP.
- [[artificial/prod_rbf_cosine_kernel]] is our model trained on the artificial data set using the product
  of a squared exponential kernel and a cosine kernel as the covariance function for the gating network GP.
- =svgp_cycle.npz= is the result of running a sparse variational GP (SVGP) on the motorcycle data set.
  It is used in [[src/visualization]] for generating plots comparing our method to a SVGP.
