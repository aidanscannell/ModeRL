#+TITLE: Examples

This document can be used to get familiar with =mogpe=.

=mogpe= is used learn Mixture's of Gaussian process experts on three example data sets:

1. The motorcycle (mcycle) data set,
2. A real-world 2D data set of a quadcopter flying in a room subject to spatially varying turbulence.
3. A simulated 2D quadcopter (point mass) subject to spatially varying turbulence.

Each example has a set of =toml= configuration files which specify the initial model parameters and training hyperparameters.
The scripts can be run from this directory =/path/to/mogpe/examples/= using the following lines,
#+begin_src shell
cd /path/to/mogpe/examples/
poetry shell
python -m mcycle.train_from_model_config
#+end_src
or for the quadcopter example,
#+begin_src shell
cd /path/to/mogpe/examples/
poetry shell
python -m quadcopter.train_from_model_config
#+end_src
