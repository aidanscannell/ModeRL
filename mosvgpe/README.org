This directory contains all of the source code.

The [[./mixture_of_experts][mixture_of_experts]] directory contains an abstract base class for mixture of experts models
as well as the main =MixtureOfSVGPExperts= class.
The =MixtureOfSVGPExperts= class implements a variational lower bound for a mixture of 
Gaussian processes experts with a GP-based gating network.
The =MixtureOfExperts= base class relies on composition and its constructor requires
an instance of the =GatingNetworkBase= class and an instance of the =ExpertsBase= class
(defined in [[./gating_networks][gating_networks]] and [[./experts][experts]] respectively).
The abstract base classes outline what methods must be implemented for gating networks
and experts to be valid; so that they can be used with a child of =MixtureOfExperts=.
