* =mosvgpe= - Mixtures of Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Experts in TensorFlow/GPflow

This package implements a Mixtures of Gaussian Process Experts model with a GP-based gating network.
Inference exploits factorisation through sparse GPs and trains a variational lower bound stochastically.
It also provides the building blocks for implementing other Mixtures of Gaussian Process Experts models.
=mosvgpe= uses [[https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow.git][GPflow 2.5]]/[[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git][TensorFlow 2.4+]] for running computations, which allows fast execution on GPUs, and uses Python â‰¥ 3.8.
It was originally created by [[https://www.aidanscannell.com/][Aidan Scannell]].

** Install
This is a Python package that should be installed into a virtual environment.
Start by cloning the repo from Github:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/aidanscannell/mosvgpe.git
#+end_src
The package can then be installed into a virtual environment by adding it as a local dependency.
*** Install with pip
Create a new virtualenv and activate it, for example,
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python -m venv mosvgpe-env
source mosvgpe-env/bin/activate
#+END_SRC
cd into the root of this package and install it and its dependencies with,
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install .
#+END_SRC
If you want to develop the =mosvgpe= codebase then install it in "editable" or "develop" mode with:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install -e .
#+END_SRC

** Useage
See [[./examples]].
