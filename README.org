* Mixture of Gaussian Process Experts using Stochastic Variational Inference

# This repository contains the code accompanying NeurIPS 2020 submission
# /Mixture of Two Gaussian Process Experts using Stochastic Variational Inference/.
This repository contains code implementing a mixture of Gaussian process (GPs)
experts method where the gating network is also implemented using GPs.
The model leverages code from GPflow/TensorFlow and trains the model
with stochastic variational inference by exploiting the factorization achieved
by sparse GPs. More details on the source code can be found in [[./src/README.org][README.org]].
