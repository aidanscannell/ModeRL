* =mogpe= - Mixture of Gaussian Process Experts in TensorFlow 

This package implements a modern mixture of Gaussian process
experts (MoGPE) inference for GP based gating networks.
=mogpe= uses [[https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow.git][GPflow 2.0]]/[[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git][TensorFlow 2.1+]] for running computations, which allows fast execution on GPUs, and uses Python â‰¥ 3.6.

Inference exploits factorization through sparse GPs and trains a variational lower bound stochastically.
More details on the source code can be found in [[./src/README.org][README.org]].
